# Cuisine-Spice-Disease-Network-Science

=======
Herbs and spices each contain about 3000 phytochemicals on average and there is much traditional knowledge on their health benefits. However, there is a lack of systematic study to understand the relationship among herbs and spices, their phytochemical constituents, their potential health benefits, and their usage in regional cuisines. Here we use a network-based approach to elucidate established relationships and predict novel associations between the phytochemicals present in herbs and spices with health indications. Our top 100 inferred indication-phytochemical relationships rediscover 40% known relationships and 20% that have been inferred via gene-chemical interactions with high confidence. The remaining 40% are hypotheses generated in a principled way for further experimental investigations. We also develop an algorithm to find the minimum set of spices needed to cover a target group of health conditions. Drawing on spice usage patterns in several regional Indian cuisines, and a copy-mutate model for regional cuisine evolution, we characterize the spectrum of health conditions covered by existing regional cuisines. The spectrum of health conditions can expand through the nationalization/globalization of culinary practice.
